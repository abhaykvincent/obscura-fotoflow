Core Features
Storing & Organizing Photos
How It Works: Upload your photos to Fotoflow’s cloud-based storage, where they are automatically organized into galleries within a project.
Key Benefits: Access your photos from anywhere, keep projects tidy, and save time searching for files.
Tips: Create a new project for each event to keep galleries organized.
Sharing Galleries
How It Works: Once photos are uploaded, generate a shareable link for each gallery. Anyone with the link can view the gallery.
Client Gallery: A passcode-protected gallery (default setting) allows clients to securely view and interact with their photos.
Coming Soon: Custom permissions and passcode protection for all galleries.
Tips: Share links via email or messaging apps directly from Fotoflow.
Selecting Photos for Final Album
How It Works: Clients can pick their favorite photos from the passcode-protected client gallery. Photographers can then copy the selected file names with one click and import them into Lightroom for editing.
Key Benefits: Streamlines collaboration and speeds up the editing process.
Tips: Ensure clients have their passcode before sharing the gallery link.
Managing Clients
How It Works: Create client profiles to store key information.
Coming Soon: Communication tools (e.g., in-app messaging) and status tracking (e.g., “Awaiting Approval,” “Delivered”).
Tips: Keep client details updated for quick reference during shoots.
Managing Shoots
How It Works: Schedule shoots, track locations, and log details like date and time within Fotoflow.
Key Benefits: Stay on top of your calendar and never miss a booking.
Tips: Add location notes to prepare for each event’s logistics.
Managing Financials
How It Works: Create invoices, track payments, and monitor expenses directly in Fotoflow.
Key Benefits: Simplify bookkeeping and maintain financial clarity for your business.
Tips: Use the payment tracking feature to follow up on outstanding invoices.
Managing Projects
How It Works: Project management tools are coming soon to help you oversee tasks, timelines, and progress for each event.
Tips: Stay tuned for updates to enhance your project oversight!
