# Feature Specification: Refactor Subscriptions Feature for Product Stabilization

**Feature Branch**: `001-refactor-subscriptions-feature`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "refactor Subscriptions feature for product stabilization"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want the Subscriptions feature's codebase to be refactored to improve its stability, performance, and maintainability, so that future development is faster and the user experience is more reliable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is running, **When** a user interacts with their subscription settings, **Then** the functionality works as it did before the refactor.
2. **Given** the refactored code, **When** a new developer reads it, **Then** the code logic is easier to understand and follow.
3. **Given** the automated test suite, **When** the tests are run against the refactored code, **Then** all existing tests for the Subscriptions feature pass.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is a data migration needed for existing user subscriptions?]
- How does system handle [error scenario]? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is a maintenance window required during deployment?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST retain all existing subscription functionality.
- **FR-002**: The refactored code MUST be covered by existing or new unit and integration tests.
- **FR-003**: The refactoring SHOULD improve code readability and reduce complexity.
- **FR-004**: System MUST NOT introduce any regressions in the Subscriptions feature or related parts of the application.
- **FR-005**: System's performance for subscription-related operations SHOULD be equal to or better than the pre-refactor performance. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific performance metrics to measure?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Subscription**: Represents a user's subscription plan, including plan type, status (active, canceled, etc.), start date, and end date.
- **User**: The user associated with the subscription.
